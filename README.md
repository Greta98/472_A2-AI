The program for this assignment is stored in a Jupyter Notebook.<br>
To run the code, the following list of libraries are necessary (these were the only ones permitted):<br>
    - import numpy as np<br>
    - import pandas as pd<br>
    - import sklearn<br>
    - import nltk<br>
    - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
    - import math<br>
    - import sys<br>

The code is written in an ordered way.<br>
Therefore, you must run each cell from the top to bottom.<br>
To run a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, simply press 'Shift + Enter'.<br>
Note, if you move the provided documents from the instructor to a different directory,<br>
you will need to change the path correspondingly in the code.<br>
