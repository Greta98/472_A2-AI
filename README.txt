The program for this assignment is stored in a Jupyter Notebook.
To run the code, the following list of libraries are necessary (these were the only ones permitted):
    - import numpy as np
    - import pandas as pd
    - import sklearn
    - import nltk
    - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    - import math
    - import sys

The code is written in an ordered way.
Therefore, you must run each cell from the top to bottom.
To run a cell in a Jupyter Notebook, simply press 'Shift + Enter'.
Note, if you move the provided documents from the instructor to a different directory,
you will need to change the path correspondingly in the code.
